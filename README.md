# low-form
An experiment to create the lowest-impact React form API.

This library was created as the result of one question: What would a form with the least code overhead look like? It provides a React component which can be wrapped around form elements in order to create a working, [uncontrolled](https://reactjs.org/docs/uncontrolled-components.html) form with simple features:

* Validation on submission
* Extendable submission handling
* Form-level and input-level error messaging
* Open to any styling

## Install

```
npm install low-form
```
